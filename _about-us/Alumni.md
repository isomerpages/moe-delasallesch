## About&nbsp;Us

### Alumni

Dear Alumni &amp; Fellow Lasallians,

The story of our Founder, St John Baptist De La Salle, should be compelling enough to catalyse Lasallians. He sought to bring change in and around his community in Rheims, France, more than 300 years ago, by introducing education to the many destitute children, living in the streets. His Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community, urge us to become persons of integrity and persons for others, values that De La Salle School actively imbues in its students. And the De La Salle Alumni Association (DLSAA) aims to keep these values alive among Lasallians.

DLSAA is still a young organisation and encouraging Lasallians to join us is still our main focus. But I am willing to wager that 6 years of education at De La Salle School must have touched the hearts of a number of Lasallians, enough to motivate them to contribute their time and energy in making DLSAA an active and vibrant body. These young Lasallians are the future and their ideas, enthusiasm and selfless giving will be the lifeblood of our organisation. And I would like to appeal to Lasallians to join us.

Joining DLSAA also offers Lasallians a gateway to the larger Lasallian community both in Singapore and the world formed by about 4,000 Brothers, who together with 90,000 men and women teachers and numerous other Lay associates help run over 1,500 Lasallian educational institutions in 82 countries with over 900,000 students, children, youth and even adults. We have a proud tradition, a unique identity and a set of shared values which together become our greatest asset. Let’s leverage on it to ignite a sense of a deep yearning of wanting to give back to our alma mater and pay it forward to the larger community of Lasallians.

Even as we strive to strengthen our bonds within our Lasallian community, our Lasallian mission demands of us to be inclusive and to serve our wider community, irrespective of race, religion and social status. De La Salle School is already carrying out this mission by providing education to residents in the heartlands of Choa Chu Kang. And DLSAA aims to continue this mission by working with the School through our activities, whether it be games, social activities, reunions, school talks or mentorship programmes. 

The DLSAA Committee Members and I are excited about the school’s future and its students and what it holds for our partnership to strengthen and grow the alumni association. I encourage students and Lasallians to sign up by clicking on the link on the top right hand corner of the page. Associate Membership for all Lasallians in school is free. I look forward to journeying with you to a create a more vibrant alumni association with a heart to pay it forward with your active participation. <br>
Thank you.

Semper Fidelis!<br>
Herald Bangras<br>
President<br>
DLSAA

### INFORMATION ON P1 REGISTRATION UNDER PRIORITY PHASE 2A1

If you have a child that will be going to Primary One next year, you will have to register him/her in the current year around the month of July.

If you are a member of the DLSAA (De La Salle Alumni Association), your child could potentially receive priority registration under Phase2A1 which is reserved for all alumni members.

However, in order to qualify for Phase 2A1, you would have to be an alumni member for at least one year before the P1 registration of your child.

In other words, you would have had to be an alumni member for approximately 1-and-a half years before your child goes to Primary One.

Please see the diagram below for better clarity of this.

Alumni members who would like P1 registration for their children under priority Phase 2A1should write an email to the Alumni [dlsaalumni@gmail.com](mailto:dlsaalumni@gmail.com) with details of their full name, NRIC No, full name(s) of your child(ren) and date of application of membership. We will then write to you with a letter to present to the School to confirm your eligibility under Phase 2A1.

DLSS's Funtastic Fiesta 2015 Fund-Raiser

De La Salle School had its food and funfare, FUNTASTIC FIESTA 2015, on Saturday, 31 January 2015 at the school's premises at Choa Chu Kang.

The alumni association did its part by helping to man one of the games stalls. The association also took the opportunity to raise some funds for its own activities by selling mainly toys at its flea market stall.

The event was graced by Guest-of-Honour, Mr Alex Yam, who is the MP for Choa Chu Kang GRC. He was accompanied by Principal, Mrs Sing, VPs, Mr Chan and Mr Ching, Chairman of the SMC, Mr Kuo, and President of the DLSAA, Mr Bangras, as they sat through some wonderful dance performances and viewed the various stalls during a walkabout later on.

Mr Yam greeted visitors, parents and children alike with his trademark smile and friendly banter. Here are some pictures of the performances, his walkabout and pictures of our alumni volunteers manning the stalls.

### THE INAUGURAL LASALLE INTER-ALUMNI FUTSAL TOURNAMENT 2015

This tournament is probably one of the first, if not the first activity that brought together the old boys of all the CBS primary schools in friendly competition. Even though we are all from different schools there was an uncanny familiarity and bond that was palpable throughout the tournament - the LaSallian spirit.  
  
The competition was stiff and fierce at times, as was expected but in the end the LaSallian sense of true sportsmanship prevailed and all the old boys were thankful that they were able to partake of this event and renew old ties.  
  
For the DLSAA - we were mainly represented by a group of old boys from the 1983 DLSS batch. Most of them went on to SJI and graduated from there in 1987. They are Allan Toh, Jeffrey Ng, Bernard Chia, Louis Nathan, Francis Selvan, Edmund Ng, Wai Keong and Niklas Leong. I applaud your competitive spirit and your eagerness to play for your alma mater.  
  
We played a fantastic 1st match against SAB and won by a big margin, 6-2. Took the foot off the pedal in the 2nd match and got punished by SSS 2-1. The final match against the tournament favourites, SMSAA, we lost 4-2 as fatigue and injuries put paid to any chances of winning the tournament. Overall the DLSAA team gave a good account of themselves and have a solid base on which to build on from.  
  
Thanks to SMSAA (St Mike's) for taking the lead role in organising this tournament. They provided the venue, drinks, the St Michael's Challenge Shield and the medals, which was a surprise. Everyone who participated got a medal, a nice touch to end off the tournament in true LaSallian spirit.  
  
Check out the photos and the videos on our FB page .The SAB players are in blue jerseys, SMSAA in red and DLSAA in green. Cheers!
