## About&nbsp;Us

### Alumni

Dear Alumni &amp; Fellow Lasallians,

The story of our Founder, St John Baptist De La Salle, should be compelling enough to catalyse Lasallians. He sought to bring change in and around his community in Rheims, France, more than 300 years ago, by introducing education to the many destitute children, living in the streets. His Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community, urge us to become persons of integrity and persons for others, values that De La Salle School actively imbues in its students. And the De La Salle Alumni Association (DLSAA) aims to keep these values alive among Lasallians.

DLSAA is still a young organisation and encouraging Lasallians to join us is still our main focus. But I am willing to wager that 6 years of education at De La Salle School must have touched the hearts of a number of Lasallians, enough to motivate them to contribute their time and energy in making DLSAA an active and vibrant body. These young Lasallians are the future and their ideas, enthusiasm and selfless giving will be the lifeblood of our organisation. And I would like to appeal to Lasallians to join us.

Joining DLSAA also offers Lasallians a gateway to the larger Lasallian community both in Singapore and the world formed by about 4,000 Brothers, who together with 90,000 men and women teachers and numerous other Lay associates help run over 1,500 Lasallian educational institutions in 82 countries with over 900,000 students, children, youth and even adults. We have a proud tradition, a unique identity and a set of shared values which together become our greatest asset. Let’s leverage on it to ignite a sense of a deep yearning of wanting to give back to our alma mater and pay it forward to the larger community of Lasallians.

Even as we strive to strengthen our bonds within our Lasallian community, our Lasallian mission demands of us to be inclusive and to serve our wider community, irrespective of race, religion and social status. De La Salle School is already carrying out this mission by providing education to residents in the heartlands of Choa Chu Kang. And DLSAA aims to continue this mission by working with the School through our activities, whether it be games, social activities, reunions, school talks or mentorship programmes. 

The DLSAA Committee Members and I are excited about the school’s future and its students and what it holds for our partnership to strengthen and grow the alumni association. I encourage students and Lasallians to sign up by clicking on the link on the top right hand corner of the page. Associate Membership for all Lasallians in school is free. I look forward to journeying with you to a create a more vibrant alumni association with a heart to pay it forward with your active participation. <br>
Thank you.

Semper Fidelis!<br>
