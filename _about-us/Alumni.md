Dear Alumni & Fellow Lasallians,

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…it was the season of Light, it was a season of Darkness…”. This is the opening line of the novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by one of the greatest authors of the Victorian era, Charles Dickens. We live in extraordinary times and at the time of writing, Singapore was just emerging out of the circuit-breaker period imposed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. And it harkened back to Dicken’s seminal book which was set in the years leading up to the French Revolution. I don’t believe the situation here is as grave as those times but not many Lasallians have ever experienced anything quite like this pandemic. This virus has brought so much devastation to businesses and economies and disrupted our way of life, how we work, study, play and even worship.

The pandemic has forced us to re-examine our lives, question our priorities and even our purpose in this world. It brought out both the best and the worst in people but we really do not need a pandemic to remind us of our humanity, our connectedness and our common destiny.

The story of our Founder, St John Baptist De La Salle, should be compelling enough to catalyse Lasallians. He sought to bring change in and around his community in Rheims, France, more than 300 years ago, by introducing education to the many destitute children, living in the streets. His Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community, urge us to become persons of integrity and persons for others, values that De La Salle School actively imbues in its students. And the De La Salle Alumni Association (DLSAA) aims to keep these values alive among Lasallians.

DLSAA is still a very young organisation and encouraging Lasallians to join us is still our number one challenge. But I am willing to wager that 6 years of education at De La Salle School must have touched the hearts of a number of Lasallians, enough to motivate them to contribute their time and energy in making DLSAA an active and vibrant body. These young Lasallians are the future and their ideas, enthusiasm and selfless giving will be the lifeblood of our organisation. And I would like to appeal to Lasallians to join us.

Joining DLSAA also offers Lasallians a gateway to the larger Lasallian community both in Singapore and the world formed by about 4,000 Brothers, who together with 90,000 men and women teachers and numerous other Lay associates help run over 1,500 Lasallian educational institutions in 82 countries with over 900,000 students, children, youth and even adults.

We have a proud tradition, a unique identity and a set of shared values which together become our greatest asset. Let’s leverage on it to ignite a sense of a deep yearning of wanting to give back to our alma mater and pay it forward to the larger community of Lasallians.

DLSAA also aims to build connections and bridges within our community through our activities, whether it be games, social activities, reunions, school talks or mentorship programmes. The DLSAA Committee Members and I are excited about the school’s future and its students and what it holds for us to partner, strengthen and grow the alumni association. I encourage students and Lasallians to sign up by clicking on the link on the top right hand corner of the page.

I look forward to welcoming you and hope you will find your way back home because home is where the heart is and where your alma mater resides.

Thank you.

Semper Fidelis!

### INFORMATION ON P1 REGISTRATION UNDER PRIORITY PHASE 2A1

If you have a child that will be going to Primary One next year, you will have to register him/her in the current year around the month of July.

If you are a member of the DLSAA (De La Salle Alumni Association), your child could potentially receive priority registration under Phase2A1 which is reserved for all alumni members.

However, in order to qualify for Phase 2A1, you would have to be an alumni member for at least one year before the P1 registration of your child.

In other words, you would have had to be an alumni member for approximately 1-and-a half years before your child goes to Primary One.

Please see the diagram below for better clarity of this.
