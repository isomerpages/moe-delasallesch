De La Salle School in Kampong Bahru opened its classrooms in January 1952 under the charge of Rev Bro Thomas, Headmaster and Director. The first batch of teachers and pupils came on transfer from SJI. There were 7 teachers and 196 boys in seven classes, from Primary 1 to Standard 5.

His Lordship, the bishop of Malacca, Monsignor Micheal Olcomendy blessed the school on 24 January 1952.

On 14 May 1952, it was officially declared open by Mr R M Young, the Director of Education.

In November 1992, De La Salle School accepted the offer from the Ministry of Education for relocation to Choa Chu Kang on quid-pro-quo terms. It meant that the school would exchange her freehold land in Kampong Bahru for a site in Choa Chu Kang and be provided with a 90% government grant to develop the standard facilities of a primary school.
