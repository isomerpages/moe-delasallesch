### Our School Rally & Songs

#### SCHOOL RALLY 

<p align="center"> All through De La Salle a voice is resounding<br>
Promptly respond to your duty's sweet call,<br>
Harken you all, for the trumpet is sounding,<br>
Your mater's proclaiming her watchword to all<br><br>
Chorus:<br><br>
Forward La Sallians dear<br>
Ever with hearts sincere <br>
Render with joy to your mater her due<br>
All that is vile reject<br>
Heaven will e'er protect<br>
Heirs of De La Salle, valiant and true<br><br>
"Always be faithful" your motto still bearing<br>
Forward with courage in ways that are just<br>
True to your standard be doing and daring<br>
As faithful La Sallians in heaven you trust </p>

Friend and father of the young <br>
Patron of Lasallian teachers<br>
We acknowledge you in song<br>
Thanking God we proudly name you<br>
