<figcaption>This five-pointed and radiant star is taken from the Crest of the Institute of the Christian Brothers. The star is a reminder of the star of Bethlehem - the star which led the Wise Men to Christ. For these Magi, it was their sign of their faith. It is the motto of the Brothers. Like the Magi, the star is a symbol of faith as Christians and their inspiration. It reminds them to reach always for the reachable star of their convictions and ideals. In short, it stands for our faith in God.

<figcaption>The coat of arms of the De La Salle Family, coming down from medieval times, features chevrons or sets of triangles leaning towards each other. In these, the Brothers see a powerful symbol of mutual dependence or Brotherhood. In a way, the chevrons also recall the type of white collar "Rabat" which traditionally has been worn by the Brothers.
