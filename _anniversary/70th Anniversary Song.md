To commemorate and celebrate our 70th anniversary, our Primary 4 and 5 budding musicians embarked on a journey to write about their dreams and aspirations; sharing interesting stories of their Lasallian experience; which have forged their Lasallian identity. With that, our teachers drew inspirations from these young writers’ stories and curated a song. The lyrics are stories that resonate and connect with the voices of our Lasallians. Reveling in the spirit, our music teachers composed the melody – a tune that sparks joy and hope in the hearts of our Lasallians. 

In the spirit of one Lasallian family, our dedicated parents have also chimed in with their musical talents, adding gestures to add groove to the beat. 

  

Our song production team and singers- comprising our staff, alumni and Lasallians, worked hand in hand to record the vocals for the song in one voice. 

  

With that, we are proud to present to you, our 70th anniversary theme song, “Our Mission Never Ends”.
