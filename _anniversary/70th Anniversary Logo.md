### 70th Anniversary Logo

To mark De La Salle School’s 70th Anniversary, this commemorative logo encapsulates the overarching theme of the school’s celebration – “Passing on the passion, 70 years and beyond.” 

  

The shape of the number ’7’ is an abstraction of an arrow. An arrow represents direction, ambition and a desire for action. The upward orientation of the arrow represents our aspiration as a Lasallian community to reach greater heights. 

  

The multiple lines on the number ‘0’ were inspired by a running track as it signifies the track record of all the achievements made by the Lasallian community through the years. It is also a reminder for us to stay faithful to our convictions and ideals as we continue on in our journey.
