### Principal's Foreword


![](/images/Principal's%20Foreword.jpg)

It is both an honour and privilege for me to serve in our Lasallian Community and be part of our special 70th Anniversary celebrations. For 70 years, De La Salle School has been true to her mission of passing on the passion of our Founder, St.John Baptist De La Salle, to serve the last, the lost and the least. His dream of providing education for the poor has come a long way to empower and grow the fraternity of Lasallians around the world.  
  
The spark of La Salle has inspired many who have benefitted from his passion to serve and give back to the community. Today we have a strong alumni of Lasallians from the Kampong Bahru, Teck Whye and Choa Chu Kang campuses who still give generously back to the school in different ways. We also have Lasallians who have come back to serve our school as teachers to help mould and nurture younger Lasallians into good citizens for the community. Hence, our values of Faith, Service and Community are ever enduring and have been anchors to see us through the tide of time.  
  
As we move towards the next 70 years of our future, we have asked ourselves how to continue firing up the dream of our Founder. What is our dream for De La Salle School? My dream for our school is to enable Lasallians to be the beacon of light for each other and the community. Children are a gift from God and together with our parents and staff, we hope to nurture our children to discover their own gifts and use them well for the better good of others. May they always be joyful, love learning and bring hope to the next generation of Lasallians to come.  
  
I would like to express my appreciation to the La Salle Brothers for their constant support and encouragement. This year, the Brothers will be celebrating the 170th Anniversary of the Lasallian East Asia District. We would like to thank them for their dedication to the mission.  
  
I hope that you will enjoy walking down memory lane with us through this coffee table book lovingly crafted by our Publication Team. Each of you reading this book, has a part to play in the history of our school. Without you, the spark of La Salle would not have been able to burn so brightly for the past 70 years. For our Lasallians still in school, this is your mission now — to pass on your passion to create a future that can touch hearts and transform lives. In the words of our Founder, “You too can perform miracles by touching the hearts of those entrusted to your care.” Our mission never ends...
