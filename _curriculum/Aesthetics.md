## Curriculum

### Aesthetics

Through Art and Music domains, our school’ Aesthetics curriculum and programs aim to develop Lasallians who have:

*   A keen eye and mindfulness to his or her environment;
*   A heightened sense of appreciation for the Arts;
*   An inquisitive mind filled with wonder and creativity;
*   And an expressive nature that defines their thoughts and ideas.

To achieve these student outcomes, the school has put in place structured Aesthetics programs that provide the opportunities and platforms for our Lasallians to develop critical Arts skills and competencies. We create authentic learning environment in Arts that allows Lasallians to see meaning and relevance to their environment; hence giving them the platforms to apply their acquired skills to express and imagine through Arts.

Besides the learning component, serving and community outreach through Arts is also one of the department focus. This is in alignment to our school’ strategic direction of developing Lasallians with a mindful servant leadership.

Our Talent Management Framework will also provide Lasallians who demonstrate aptitude and competencies in a specific domain of Arts eg) singing, dance, music or visual Art an extensive platform for them to develop and strengthen their skills in that area.

As Lasallians embark on their Arts Education journey, we hope to develop students who have the ability to view Arts in a larger context and as part of their environment; while being equipped with the critical life skills and 21st core competencies as they explore, experience and engage through Arts.
