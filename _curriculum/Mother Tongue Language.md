## Curriculum

### Mother Tongue Language

The objective of studying the Mother Tongue language is to learn the basic language skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing, while also explaining the cultural values and values needed for the growth of students. Students are taught basic language skills and thinking skills, as well as areas regarding national education, information technology, social and emotional learning.  The new Mother Tongue language curriculum aims to make language learning more enjoyable, in hope that the students would take Mother Tongue Language beyond the classroom. Key learning areas include listening and speaking more, as well as building a firm foundation in Mother Tongue character learning skills in lower primary before developing essay skills in upper primary. Our school has also taken on a differentiated approach in ensuring that each student will learn the language to the best of their abilities via a step-by-step process.

#### MT FORTNIGHT WEEK

The Mother Tongue fortnight programmes will be conducted over two weeks for all levels in semester one. The objective is to create a platform for all Lasallians to learn about their culture and traditions through various activities. Chinese painting, CNY singing competition, lion dance competition and mandarin orange making are some of activities planned for them. Batik colouring and yellow packet making allow students to learn about the essence of the Malay and Tamil culture and tradition. These activities allowed Lasallians to have fun as well as to appreciate their culture.

#### INTERNATIONALIZATION IMMERSION

The objective is to develop Lasallians’ global outlook and cultural awareness through immersion in foreign school and to appreciate the rich cultures and heritage beyond the confines of the classroom.  Through immersion in a different environment where the languages are taught, Lasallians are able to apply and enhance their command in the Mother Tongue Languages.
