### Mother Tongue Language

The objective of studying the Mother Tongue language is to learn the basic language skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing, while also explaining the cultural values and values needed for the growth of students. Students are taught basic language skills and thinking skills, as well as areas regarding national education, information technology, social and emotional learning.Â  The new Mother Tongue language curriculum aims to make language learning more enjoyable, in hope that the students would take Mother Tongue Language beyond the classroom. Key learning areas include listening and speaking more, as well as building a firm foundation in Mother Tongue character learning skills in lower primary before developing essay skills in upper primary. Our school has also taken on a differentiated approach in ensuring that each student will learn the language to the best of their abilities via a step-by-step process.
