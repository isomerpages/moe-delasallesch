## Curriculum

### Social Studies

Social Studies is a student’s first introduction to humanities, where they are exposed to elements of geography, history, sociology and economics. It is also part of their character and citizenship education where they learn more about Singapore and cultivate their sense of belonging to the community and nation.

The Social Studies curriculum in De La Salle School endeavours to mould our Lasallians to become an informed, concerned, and participative citizen. We aim to do that by providing authentic learning experiences for our Lasallians through their learning journeys. Emphasis is also placed on the application of knowledge and skills, as well as the acquisition of values. Lasallians are given a chance to collaborate and demonstrate their learning through the various performance tasks. Ultimately, we strive to plant the seed of curiosity and interest in Humanities for our Lasallians.
