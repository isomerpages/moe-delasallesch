## Curriculum

### Character & Citizenship Education

In order to enable our Lasallians to live out the school mission “to learn how to learn and to learn how to live; to be persons of integrity and persons for others”, the CCE department brings about a holistic character education through the learning approach of Education, Opportunities and Support. As Lasallians journey through their foundational years of education with the school, he/she will participate in various authentic learning experiences and lessons, which seeks to inculcate values and build competencies in our Lasallians to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.

#### CCE Curriculum
1. **Form Teacher Guidance Period ( FTGP)**<br>
The objectives of FTGP are to:<br>
 *   Provide quality interaction time between form teachers and pupils, and<br>
 *   Equip pupils with social and emotional (SEL) competencies.
   
In addition to the SEL competencies that are explicitly taught, form teacher also bond with Lasallians through interaction activities. Lessons on Cyber Wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and protection from abuse (Primary 1 to 4) have been incorporated in FTGP lessons to address specific issues and to reinforce the core values.

2. **CCE Lessons**<br>
CCE lessons in the Primary levels are taught in the Mother Tongues Languages (MTL). For students who offer the non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL) as their Mother Tongue and for those exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English.

Lasallians will learn the values, knowledge and skills through three overarching ideas, namely Identity, Relationships and Choices. Topics in CCE lessons also spread across six domains, namely self, family, school, community, nation and the world.

3. **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**<br>
To encourage learning beyond the classroom, PAL is offered to Primary 1 and 2 Lasallians. PAL gives opportunities to Lasallians the chance to discover new interests, learn new skills and develop character. Lasallians will also have the opportunity during curriculum time to try out activities in sports and outdoor education, as well as in the performing and visual arts.

4. **Sexuality Education in Schools**<br>
Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.

5. **Lifeskills Lessons and Religious Education**<br>
Being a Catholic school, we provide for the spiritual nourishment of our Lasallians through our Catholic faith formation curriculum and practices. Catholic Lasallians are expected to attend our Bible-based Catechism classes faithfully, in addition to the Sacrament-based Catechism classes conducted in their parish. Our school’s Catechism classes are complementary but not replacements for those in Church.

While these Lasallians are attending Catechism classes, all other Lasallians will have lessons on Lifeskills. There are thus two concurrent programmes to cater to Lasallians’ moral and social growth. The only difference is that Catechism, besides its focus on inculcating values, has a faith formation dimension and content while the latter programme touches on universal values, personal and social-emotional development.

#### Programmes

1. **Values-In-Action Programme - Home Away from Home**<br>
De La Salle School focusses on nurturing our pupils the Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community as well as the School Values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience. Besides providing platforms for explicit teaching of such values and discernment skills, the School also provides opportunities for pupils to demonstrate the values and skills learnt. The opportunities are categorised under domains such as School, Community, Country and the World. These opportunities are held together by our Values In Action theme of Home Away from Home and our school’s Gratitude Movement. It is our hope that our Lasallians see their school, community, country and the world as their home and be appreciative towards the people around them.

2. **Friends for Life Induction Programme ( FLIP)**<br>
At the start of each new school year, we have the FLIP programme for every class. In this induction programme, we focus on building new friendships and forming a class identity.

3. **LEARN EXPERIENCE AND FULFIL (LEAF)**<br>
LEAF is a time when Lasallians will put aside their academic books and participate in character and citizenship building activities. This programme brings together staff, Lasallians and parents of the school and promotes a culture of learning beyond the classroom. Through interdisciplinary integration, we bring learning out from the confines of the classrooms to explicitly teach different values for character and citizenship development. We believe that experiential learning has a more lasting and impactful presence in the lives of our Lasallians.

4. **LEADERSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMME (TITLES)**<br>
Leadership opportunities are widely available through class committees, CCA leaders and captains from the various sports groups, prayer leaders as well as Lasallian Leaders. Each of them plays a different role within their own spheres of influence to serve the needs of the Lasallians under their care. TITLES is a learning cycle which we use to aid our Lasallians’ development as a student leader in the classroom and in school wide positions as well. We use the same framework to allow our Lasallians to understand their development as a leader and how they can further grow into the leader that they can be.

5. **SHINE Programme**<br>
The SHINE Programme focuses on supporting academically low-progress Lasallians who are at risk of losing interest and motivation in their learning. The programme aims to enhance the Social and Emotional (SE) Competencies of the selected Lasallians.

Through the acquisition and application of the SE Competencies, Lasallians will be able to recognise and manage their emotions better which in turn enable them to overcome challenging situations and make responsible decisions.

6. **DRUM Programme**<br>
The DRUM programme provides opportunities for the selected Lasallians to develop and enhance their self-regulatory skills. In the programme, self-regulatory skills and social skills are explicitly taught to the Lasallians. The Lasallians will be able to develop social emotional skills and exercise discernment through experiential learning.

The programme uses drumming as a platform to allow the Lasallians to apply their learning in real life situations where they are required to demonstrate high level of concentration, coordination and teamwork.
