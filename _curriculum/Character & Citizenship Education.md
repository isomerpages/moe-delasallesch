### Character & Citizenship Education

In order to enable our Lasallians to live out the school mission “to learn how to learn and to learn how to live; to be persons of integrity and persons for others”, the CCE department brings about a holistic character education through the learning approach of Education, Opportunities and Support. As Lasallians journey through their foundational years of education with the school, he/she will participate in various authentic learning experiences and lessons, which seeks to inculcate values and build competencies in our Lasallians to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.

#### CCE Curriculum
1. **Form Teacher Guidance Period ( FTGP)**<br>
The objectives of FTGP are to:<br>
 *   Provide quality interaction time between form teachers and pupils, and<br>
 *   Equip pupils with social and emotional (SEL) competencies.
   
In addition to the SEL competencies that are explicitly taught, form teacher also bond with Lasallians through interaction activities. Lessons on Cyber Wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and protection from abuse (Primary 1 to 4) have been incorporated in FTGP lessons to address specific issues and to reinforce the core values.
