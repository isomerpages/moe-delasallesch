## Curriculum

### English Language

The English Language Department aims to develop Lasallians who are engaged and passionate learners of the English Language. Critical and creative thinking strategies are infused into the curriculum and reading, speaking and writing activities are carried out in the language classroom to allow Lasallians to see the purpose in learning the language, experience the joy of learning and become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and critical inquirers.

#### Key Programmes

1. **Reading Programme**<br>
In De La Salle School, the reading programme aims to create a positive experience in reading among our Lasallians. The reading programme aims to:

*   develop good reading habits and increase motivation to read among Lasallians
*   promote reading for pleasure
*   develop in Lasallians an appreciation for local literature and stories
*   expose Lasallians to different text types, genres, authors and series and current affairs

**Extensive Reading Programme during Curriculum**<br>
Lasallians are engaged in reading activities and discussions based on the following focus areas during weekly reading periods:<br>
Primary 1 – Poetry<br>
Primary 2 – Fairy Tales<br>
Primary 3 – Books by Roald Dahl<br>
Primary 4 – Singapore Literature<br>
Primary 5/6 – Current Affairs

P5 and P6 students subscribe to ‘Little Red Dot’ – an educational supplement by SPH. This is to encourage an interest in current affairs and build on their understanding of civics and media literacy.

**Library Programmes**<br>
Beyond the classrooms, storytelling sessions, quizzes, book discussions and many other activities are conducted in the library to promote reading in the library during recess.

**Book Battle**<br>
Lasallians in Primary 4-Primary 6 engage in a book battle to showcase their knowledge on books. Selected Lasallians will represent the school in the annual KidLit Quiz organized by NLB.
