## Curriculum

### English Language

The English Language Department aims to develop Lasallians who are engaged and passionate learners of the English Language. Critical and creative thinking strategies are infused into the curriculum and reading, speaking and writing activities are carried out in the language classroom to allow Lasallians to see the purpose in learning the language, experience the joy of learning and become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and critical inquirers.
