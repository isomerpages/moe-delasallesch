## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Hockey

A team game played between two teams of players each, using hooked sticks with which the players try to drive a small hard ball towards goals at opposite ends of a field outdoors. Hockey CCA in De La Salle School aims to develop passion and love for this Olympic sport in all of its members.  

Hockey members will have the opportunity to display the values of sportsmanship, perseverance and teamwork through the CCA sessions. Members are able to forge friendships and strong camaraderie amongst their team members as they pursue sporting excellence through participation in National School Games at Senior and Junior Divisions.
