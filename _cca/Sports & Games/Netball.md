### Netball

In Netball at De La Salle School, we aim to develop resilient, committed and discipline players who put in their best at all times.

Netball is a sport that trains agility, speed and endurance. Besides training our netballers to meet the physical requirements of the game, they are also educated on the Olympic Values of Friendship, Respect & Excellence which seek to develop positive attitudes and 21st Century Competencies.

Lastly, we hope to use Netball as a platform to nurture mental strength, team spirit and sportsmanship in every player.
