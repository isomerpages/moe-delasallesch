## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Netball
#### Overview of CCA
In Netball at De La Salle School, we aim to develop resilient, committed and discipline players who always put in their best.

Netball is a sport that trains agility, speed and endurance. Besides training our netballers to meet the physical requirements of the game, they are also educated on the school values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience.

Through an array of curated modified games, the girls learn the fundamental skills like ball-handling, throwing and catching and the various locomotor skills that are essential in netball in a fun and positive environment.
