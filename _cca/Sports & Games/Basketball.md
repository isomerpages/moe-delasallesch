## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Basketball

#### Overview of CCA

At De La Salle School, our Basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) offers students an exciting platform to develop their athletic skills, build character, and foster teamwork through the dynamic and fast-paced sport of basketball. The Basketball CCA focuses on nurturing potential while instilling values such as discipline, perseverance, and sportsmanship. During our weekly training sessions, students engage in structured drills that cover core basketball fundamentalsâ€”dribbling, passing, shooting, and defense. They also participate in friendly matches, game simulations, and fitness conditioning to build stamina and agility. Our experienced coaches provide personalised guidance to help each student grow in skill, confidence, and game awareness. Beyond physical training, we emphasize the importance of communication, respect, and team spirit both on and off the court.

#### What Students Will Experience 

1. Learn and apply basketball fundamentals in a progressive, age-appropriate manner.
2. Develop teamwork and leadership skills by working closely with peers during training and matches.
