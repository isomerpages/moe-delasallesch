At De La Salle school, Rugby is one of the character-building sports that fosters courage, fitness, team effort and togetherness. Regular participation not only increases muscular strength and fitness, it can develop mental skills of self-control and discipline.

Selected School Team Rugby players would get to play friendly games with other schools and participate in annual National Schools Rugby Championships.

Through all these exposures and trainings, we hope to develop our Lasallians sense Respect, Responsibility and Resilience.
