## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Rugby

#### Overview of CCA

Rugby is one of the character-building sports that DLSS offers. It fosters Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, fitness, skills, team effort and School Identity. Regular participation in this sport not only increases muscular strength and endurance. It can also develop mental strengths such as self-control and self-discipline.

Selected rugby players would have a chance to participate in the Rugby Ready Clinic to assess their readiness before taking part in the annual National Schools Games (NSG) Rugby Championships. They would also have a chance to compete with other schools through friendly matches at the clinic.

With these exposures and trainings, we hope to develop our Lasallians who are anchored on our Lasallian Values of Faith, Service and Community.

#### What Students Will Experience

1.	Spirit of Faith and Service to Community
2.	Sense of belonging to the Lasallian Family
