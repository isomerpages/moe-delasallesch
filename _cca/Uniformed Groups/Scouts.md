## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Scouts
#### Overview of CCA
Cub Scouts is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that nurtures Lasallians’ character, confidence, and leadership through engaging hands-on experiences and outdoor adventures. Rooted in the values of the worldwide Scouting movement, the programme empowers students to live out the Scout Promise and Law, while learning through purposeful and enjoyable activities.

The CCA is designed to develop resilience, teamwork, and a spirit of service. Students are given opportunities to learn practical outdoor skills such as knot-tying, map reading, and basic first aid. They participate in patrol-based games and challenges that foster communication and collaboration, while building self-discipline and a sense of responsibility.

Throughout the year, Cub Scouts apply what they have learned during school-based activities, community service projects, and national-level Scouting events. These experiences support their growth into confident and caring individuals who contribute meaningfully to the school and wider community. This reflects our Lasallian values of Faith, Service, and Community, as our Scouts strive to serve others and grow in character.

The Scouting programme brings together the children to experience new adventures and friendships. With these exciting activities and experiences, the children build confidence, develop leadership and acquire other important life skills. Through the Scout’s honour, they are empowered to live out the values of trust, loyalty and help others to promote peace and respect in a warm inclusive environment.
