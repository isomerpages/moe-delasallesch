## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Scouts

The Scouting programme brings together the children to experience new adventures and friendships. With these exciting activities and experiences, the children build confidence, develop leadership and acquire other important life skills. Through the Scoutâ€™s honour, they are empowered to live out the values of trust, loyalty and help others to promote peace and respect in a warm inclusive environment.
