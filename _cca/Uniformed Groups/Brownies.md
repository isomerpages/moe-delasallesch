Brownies are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them and to become more independent. They are constantly learning new skills and challenged to try new and adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the future. The aim is to provide girls with the opportunity to develop their fullest potential in the development of character, promotion of service to the community and as responsible citizens of the world.
