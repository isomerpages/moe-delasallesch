## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Choir
#### Overview of CCA 
More than a chorus of voices, De La Salle Choir is a vibrant community where Lasallians come together to create harmony, build confidence, and foster friendships. Through weekly practices, performances, and workshops, our Choir members not only develop their vocal abilities but also grow as empathetic individuals with deep-rooted values in respect, responsibility and resilience.
#### What Students Will Experience 
Our choir members are immersed in a holistic vocal curriculum that nurtures: <br>
1.	**Vocal techniques** such as breath control, pitch accuracy, and harmony blending<br>
2.	**Musical literacy**, including score reading and rhythm recognition<br>
3.	**Performance skills**, from stage presence to teamwork<br>
4.	**Appreciation of diverse genres**, including classical, contemporary, cultural and pop music.<br>
These experiences enrich our young musiciansâ€™ understanding of music and equip them with lifelong skills in communication, discipline, and creativity.

#### Highlights and Opportunities

1.	**School events &amp; concerts**: From National Day to Prize Giving ceremonies <br>
2.	**Public performances**: Community events and collaborations with other schools <br>
