## Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)

### Percussion Ensemble

Percussion Ensemble is a newly-introduced CCA in 2021.  
  
To broaden the spectrum of CCA experiences for our Lasallians in the domain of Performing Arts, Percussion Ensemble aims to give the members the exposure to percussion instruments such as Cajon, drums and xylophone. Members will learn to create and increase awareness towards the art form of percussion instruments as well as the playing techniques of percussion instruments.  
  
The CCA also aims to engage the members in the Arts through the development of a sense of appreciation for the percussion instrumental music. Members will also have the opportunities to play in an ensemble with percussion instruments with sectional training. Through the CCA training sessions, school values of respect, responsibility and resilience are explicitly taught and shared.
