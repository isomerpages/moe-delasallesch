## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Mcnally Club
Club members have the opportunity to explore different art forms and experiment with both traditional and modern mediums. Lasallians learn to express their thoughts, ideas and feelings through the art making and at the same time develop their artistic skills and techniques.

Talented artists in Mcnally Club are also invited to participate in local as well as international Art competitions such as the prestigious Singapore Youth Festival, occurring every alternate year. Mcnally Club members can also look forward in participating in our schoolâ€™s community Art programmes through exhibitions and facilitations.
