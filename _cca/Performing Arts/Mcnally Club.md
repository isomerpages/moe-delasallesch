## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Mcnally Club
#### Overview of CCA 
The McNally Club is a creative space where students explore and express themselves through visual arts. Using both traditional and modern materials, they develop artistic techniques, critical thinking, and confidence in self-expression. <br>
Students learn to observe and interpret artworks from various cultures and time periods, gaining visual literacy and an appreciation for different artistic perspectives. They also take on curatorial roles by planning and organizing school exhibitions, learning to present artworks meaningfully. Learning extends beyond the classroom through visits to art galleries and studios. These experiences connect students to the wider arts community and inspire them with real-world practices. The club also offers opportunities for students to showcase their talents and lead in public events such as **ArtSeen**, where they guide visitors and represent the school’s creative spirit.
McNally Club aims to nurture confident, creative, and community-minded individuals who appreciate the value of art in everyday life.
