## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Modern Dance
#### Overview of CCA 

Modern Dance is all about **expression, creativity, and connection**. We blend contemporary, hip-hop, and lyrical styles to create performances that are powerful, emotional, and unforgettable. It’s a great way to build **confidence, discipline, and team spirit** — all while having fun and discovering your love for dance!
Every training session and performance is an opportunity to grow — not just as a dancer, but as a person. We aim to nurture **Lasallians with strong character** and a passion for excellence. Through regular practice, rehearsals, and performances, students develop important values such as respect, resilience and responsibility.
