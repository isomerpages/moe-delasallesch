Our Vision is to nurture young aspiring Lasallians to fulfil their dreams as they seek to communicate and express themselves through dance.

The Modern Dance CCA opens up a myriad of opportunities for pupils to learn and master a range of dance techniques and styles emphasizing strength, balance and endurance with importance placed on rhythmic awareness. The dancers have trained through various performances and competitions. This gives the Lasallians a platform to cultivate self-confidence and resilience enhancing their leadership qualities through teamwork.
