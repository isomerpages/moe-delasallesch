## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Media Club
#### Overview of CCA 

Media Club is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that nurtures Lasallians’ passion for videography, photography, and animation. They immerse themselves in the world of visual storytelling through hands-on experience with camera equipment and digital animation tools. 

Established in 2021, Media Club provides Lasallians with opportunities to learn camera operations, composition techniques, lighting principles, and animation fundamentals. Through practical sessions and guided instruction, they learn to create visual narratives and bring stories to life through various digital media platforms. 

Throughout the year, Lasallians apply their media knowledge and skills through school events, project work, learning journeys, and participation in exhibitions. They gain valuable experience in collaborating with others, sharing creative insights, and supporting one another to develop their technical skills. This embodies our Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community as Lasallians strive for excellence in their craft for digital media while serving the school and community.
