## Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)

### Media Club

To broaden our Lasallians’ learning experiences in the domain of Digital Arts, media club is introduced in 2021. During CCA sessions, members will acquire specific skills and knowledge pertaining to the use of camera equipment, composition techniques and how lighting can affect quality of photos. Members will also get to learn processing skills to enhance the quality of their work. School events will be some platforms for our members to practice and hone their technical skills. Learning journey will also be planned for members to bring their experience beyond school.  

As a form of showcase of their photography work, members will have the opportunity to plan and set up an exhibition in school to display their photography work and their acquired skills.
