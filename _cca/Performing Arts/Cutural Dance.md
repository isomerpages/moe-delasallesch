## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Cultural Dance

To encourage our Lasallians to develop cross-cultural skills and enhance their cultural awareness, Cultural Dance CCA was started in 2019 to provide a platform for our Lasallians to learn about the various cultures through the expression of Dance.&nbsp;  

Members will get the opportunities to learn traditional dance moves of Chinese Dance, Malay Dance and Indian Dance. After acquiring the foundational dance steps, members will then learn a fusion dance which incorporates a fusion of these three ethnic dances. Through this CCA, members learn to collaborate and adapt; enhancing their cultural sensitivity and awareness, and forging strong friendship through the experience.
