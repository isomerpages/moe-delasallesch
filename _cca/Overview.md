<h2>Co-Curricular Activities(CCA)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>CCAs are a key component of studentsâ€™ holistic education. Through CCAs,
students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also provide platforms
for students to develop their character, learn values, social emotional
competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges.</p>
<p>CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and
interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their
sense of belonging to the school and community.</p>
