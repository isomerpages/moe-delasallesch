<h2>Co-Curricular Activities(CCA)</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>CCAs are a key component of studentsâ€™ holistic education. Through CCAs,
students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also provide platforms
for students to develop their character, learn values, social emotional
competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges.</p>
<p>CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and
interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their
sense of belonging to the school and community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1) Talent Identification &amp; Development within CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>Talent Development is one of the four domains in the school's total curriculum
framework that supports the holistic development of our Lasallians. It
serves as a strength-based approach to motivate and encourage Lasallians
to pursue their passions and interests. Through CCAs, students are supported
in developing their talents, enabling them to work towards their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>  <strong>CCA Experience Day for P3 Lasallians</strong>
</p>
<p>To promote greater student agency and empowerment, a CCA Experience Day
is planned for all Primary 3 Lasallians at the end of Term 2, before they
make their CCA selections for Semester 2. Students will have the opportunity
to experience three CCAs of their choice and participate in various activities,
gaining insight into the learning experiences each CCA offers. This participation
enables Lasallians to engage in meaningful conversations with their parents
and make informed choices based on their understanding of their talents
and passions.</p>

<p><strong>3) Values-in-Action (VIA) in CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>Our talent development approach aims to give each Lasallian the opportunity
to maximise their potential, regardless of their starting point, enabling
them to use their talents in service of others. CCA groups establish meaningful
and sustainable partnerships with external organisations, leveraging skills
and knowledge acquired to contribute to the community. Through these interactions,
Lasallians learn to demonstrate the core Lasallian values of Faith, Service
and Community.</p>
