### Talking Titans
#### Overview of CCA
In Talking Titans, Lasallians learn the art of confident communication through drama, public speaking, debate, and storytelling. During the sessions, the activities allow for Lasallians to explore creative expression, develop their voice, and learn to speak with purpose and clarity. From writing and performing original scripts to hosting school events, our Titans are empowered to express themselves meaningfully while working collaboratively. Talking Titans helps Lasallians become persuasive speakers, active listeners, and empathetic communicators—skills essential for school and beyond.
