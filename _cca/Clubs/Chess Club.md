### Chess Club

The Chess Club was set up with the objective of promoting intellectual games. It aims to introduce basic chess play skills to members. Pupils are taught to think and strategise carefully before they act. During training, we discuss various chess moves and their resulting consequences. Pupils were also given opportunities to collaborate and share their knowledge with their teammates.
