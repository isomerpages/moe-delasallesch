## Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)

### Robotics Club

In Robotics club, the school has engaged a vendor to provide the training for LEGO construction and programming. Throughout the year, Lasallians will be introduced to various challenges which enhance their logical reasoning and problem solving skills. In these challenges, Lasallians also learn to work in small groups which give them opportunities to develop their communication and interpersonal skills.
