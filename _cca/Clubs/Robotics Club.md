## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Robotics Club
#### Overview of CCA
*Character precedes Success*. That is the mentality that drives CCA Robotics. More than just tinkering with Lego sets, every activity is an adventure in learning, allowing us to develop valuable competencies, inculcate learning dispositions and nurturing of values. This is done through hands-on learning and collaboratively solve real-world problems through fun robotics challenges and innovation projects.

Throughout the year, Lasallians apply their knowledge and skills through participation in competitions, events in school and external journeys. They gain valuable experience in working with others, sharing creative insights, and supporting one another to develop their technical skills and actualize their concept and their imagination. Creativity, respect, resilience, and collaboration are core to their journey as they aim high.

#### What Students Will Experience 

1. To nurture members into technology enthusiasts who are intelligent and virtuous
2. To develop students who are proficient and gracious users of technology, particularly in the field of Robotics.
3. To equip and hone their problem solving, project skills and soft skills, using competitions as a platform to apply their learning and utilizing Lego Education and Robotics sets as tools to achieve their aim
#### Highlights and Opportunities 
1. FIRST Lego League (FLL)
2. National Robotics Programming Competition (NRPC)
3. Innovation, Design and Engineering Competition (IDE)
