## Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities&nbsp;(CCA)

### Discovery Club
#### Overview of CCA
##### Discovery Club: Inspiring Young Inventors!

In Discovery Club, learning comes alive through the joy of play and making. When students engage in hands-on projects, they explore their creativity while developing critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and resilience. Each session encourages them to embrace their inner inventors, take risks, and see failure as a stepping stone to success through both physical and digital making activities.

Rooted in Design Thinking, students are empowered to explore their interests—whether building, coding, or crafting—while collaborating, sharing ideas, and learning from one another. They empathize, define problems, brainstorm solutions, prototype, and test ideas in real-world scenarios. At Discovery Club, students are inspired to invent with heart, using creativity to make a positive impact on their communities and beyond.
