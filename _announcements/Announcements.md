### 27 April- 70th Anniversary theme song ‘Our Mission Never Ends’

To commemorate and celebrate our 70th anniversary, our teachers drew inspiration from the dreams and inspirations shared by our P4 and P5 Lasallians; and curated a 70th Anniversary theme song titled ‘Our Mission Never Ends’. 

The lyrics are stories that resonate with the voices of our Lasallians; the melody is one which sparks joy and hope in the hearts of our Lasallians; and our dedicated parents have also chimed in with their musical talents. 

As one Lasallian family, our song production team and singers- comprising our staff, alumni and Lasallians, worked hand in hand to record the vocals for the song, in ONE VOICE. With that, we are proud to present to you, our 70th anniversary theme song, “Our Mission Never Ends”.<br>
