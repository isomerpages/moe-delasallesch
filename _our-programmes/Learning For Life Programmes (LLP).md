### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

<p align="center"><b>  Learning for Life Programme - Mindful Servant Leaders (MSL) at De La Salle</b></p>

In De La Salle School, we believe in providing an environment for a holistic education for all Lasallians. These include platforms for leadership growth and development with a focus on mindfulness and servitude towards the community.

The school does this by adapting our Founder’s vision of Faith, Service and Community with Robert Greenleaf’s philosophy of Servant Leadership as a guide. Broadly, it focuses on nurturing every Lasallian as a leader that is keenly aware of his potential to affect positive change to his community. He does this through building relationships, encouraging growth and development of others to reach their fullest potential. The Lasallian is therefore a mentor and source of positive change to others.

The MSL Curriculum at De La Salle School permeates across 6 years of a Lasallian’s life here in De La Salle School and takes into account the child’s developmental milestones.

The school’s MSL framework is as follows:
