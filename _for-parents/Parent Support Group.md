## For Parents

### Parent Support Group

Welcome to the De La Salle School Parent Support Group. By virtue of enrolling their children to De La Salle School, all De La Salle parents have the same opportunity to join the PSG. Parents are invited to become active members by registering to become a PSG members and then connecting with PSG meetings, activities and events. The PSG is a school-sponsored, volunteer-run-organization – here to create a community and to play the following **roles:**

**Supportive Partner in Education:**<br>
The PSG complements the school by aligning with the school’s objectives, supporting and strengthening the school’s programmes to improve Lasallian’s well-being and learning.

**Bridge Between Parents and School:**<br>
The PSG listens to parents’ feedback on school operations, practices and programmes, and provides feedback to the school. The PSG also facilitates the school’s communication to parent and provides the best vehicle to learn more about the school.

**Magnet to Attract Other Parents:**<br>
Parents who are actively involved in the PSG are better able to reach out to other parents and involve them. Over time, more parents can contribute to make the school environment more conducive for learning.

*In partnering and supporting the school, **PSG members volunteer their 3 Ts:**

**Time** – PSG can volunteer their time to design and conduct the school’s programmes and events. Supportive PSG members can help to make the school a safe place for Lasallians to learn in, making school life more vibrant and caring.

**Talent** – PSG can volunteer their expertise, talents, individual interests or personal networks. In this way, parents can significantly expand the pool of help available to the school and the PSG.

**Thoughts** –PSG can brainstorm and contribute constructive feedback and ideas to improve the school and PSG. Cluster-wide or zonal PSG forums are a great opportunity to learn and share ideas with other PSGs. More experienced parents can share experience and advice with younger parents too.

**Dos and Don’ts of PSG**<br>
When PSG come together, parents have to remember to balance their own needs and ideas with the need of the school, other parents and all the students of the school.
